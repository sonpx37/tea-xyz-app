- Setup nodejs and npm
- Create folder on github with name is tea-xyz-quest
- Access app.tea.xyz => Register a New OSS Project
- Search for the name of the package just created. For example: @sonnpx37/tea-xyz-quest. This step may take up to 2-3 days for the new package to appear in the tea.xyz system.

After that, tea will provide a file named tea.yaml. Download it and return to the GitHub repository, then proceed to upload that file, and you're done.
